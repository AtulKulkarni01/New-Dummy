"What a piece of shit is was, my name is John ."
During my holiday in Marmaris we ate here to fit the food. It's really good that the food is cheap and nice. Eating as much bread as you want is a big plus for those who are not satisfied without bread. It is a place that I can recommend to those who will go to Marmaris. On July 1 there was a small increase but even the price hike is cheap. I leave the photo of the latest prices and breakfast below. there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place..
Prices are very affordable. The menu in the photo cost 108 liras. You have to wait 10-15 minutes for food. Staff is annoying. Well it tastes good. Boiled meat was delicious.
Turkey's cheapest artisan restaurant and its food is delicious!
I don't know what you will look for in terms of price performance point; taste; but yigit restaurant writes a big plus for those who come to work in this region.
Generally good.
What you see is 125 TL in total. It's a pretty convenient place. We can say that it is an artisan restaurant; you should not expect a restaurant; but they are still quite good in terms of price and performance. As of July 1; prices will increase
Delicious food at rock bottom prices. Friendly staff; Highly recommend
"Every time I go, I still experience the amazement I experienced years ago as if it were the first time. There is no need to explain. Folk hero is a business."
The most f/p of all businesses I've seen.
The food was just like the ones my mother made. Prices were reasonable.
The ambiance of the place is nice; when we went; there was a lot of queue; and after waiting for a while; they took our place. The friend who took our order said half a half pizza and we preferred half chicken and half steak. Two people were easily satisfied; a lot of patterns.
"Flavor : It has nothing but dough taste. Labor : Not befitting a touristic place. Service : There was no wet wipes and napkins on the table, but there was no sympathetic family to say. This service and this taste were not available at this price."
It is in the center; easy to reach; close to the parking lot; the prices are partially affordable; the products are delicious but not quite satisfying; the seating places are cramped; the place is a little flat.
They make delicious pizza with nice ingredients on thin dough. Slice pizza and all pizza options are available. You can try two different flavors as a whole by making two different choices for the whole pizza. We wanted the mushroom and sausage. It was very nice; warm; and it was cooked in its consistency without drying the ingredients.
It's in a nice place but it's very small and their pizza is not that good to be exaggerated. Pizza dough is nice and thin. They do not offer advice to the customer.
I strongly recommend. If I come to the taste part; it was very enjoyable to eat with their special sauces. Also the whole pizza was huge.
It is very tasty; similar to Italian pizzas. Roast beef and mohair 180 TL; other pizzas 150 TL. An adult male eats 6 slices; pizzas are one size and 8 slices.
Do not come around Marmaris and do not leave without eating pizza at Pizza Fellas. We ate mixed pizza; they can make two types of pizza. So delicious!
I never thought that the best pizza I've ever eaten would be in Akyaka. Thin pizzas are very tasty and the options are very good. We recommend it to everyone who comes to Akyaka.
It was as if a very delicious Italian chef had come out of his hands. You can eat with pleasure. The owners are very good people. I recommend.
The pizza is big enough for 2 people. The dough is very thin. Price is between 120-140 TL.
The environment; the interest and friendliness of the employees; the taste is incredible. It is so beautiful inside that you do not prefer to sit at the bottom of the sea. Depending on the day; there are also things that are not written on the menu; be sure to check it out. Hours have passed since the meal; we are still talking about the beef brisket.
Without any taste how they are at the first rank!!!! We ate cafe Inn pizza. It was 70 tl.
Pizza is delicious.. I can say it is one of the rare tastes. Prices are in the 200-300 range and one pizza is more than enough for two people if you are not very hungry. The scenery is already gorgeous.
The vegan breakfast made me extremely happy. It was nice.
Whatever we ate was good. The Italian Restaurant is the first thing that comes to mind; apart from pizza and pasta; ciger yahni was successful; purslane salad; presentations are successful. Taste point in Datca.
Very enjoyable beautiful place. Pizza salad food taste is great.
Its breakfast is more satisfying than the places around it.
Nice intimate restaurant. Good service. Eye for detail. Clean. Really good food; well presented.
The food is delicious but a little pricey. The best Cappucino in Dat√ßa is here..
It's a very delicious; beautiful small business; but the appointment is a bit difficult to find; the pizzas are great Cafe Inn pizza and a wonderful 4 cheese and brownie as dessert. Thank you for your good wishes.
When I went; I waited for almost 20 minutes for the waiters to take care of me. The taste was not bad. The surrounding was beautiful.
"It is a very, very expensive place. It took 30 minutes for 2 drinks to arrive."
I had the creamy chicken vegetable stew. It tasted excellent. It was quite satisfying. The environment is beautiful and spacious.
quality service and rich menu. the attitude of the staff is really excellent. A business that deserves 5 stars.
The sushi was too small so it was not possible to taste the ingredients; the rice was overcooked and lacked flavor; it was missing except for the tail of the shrimp.
The staff was very engaged. Service and taste were perfect.
Perfect location next to the sea. Music; light in the evening lounge atmosphere. In short; everything is beautiful.
"It was very expensive, but taste wasn't bad."
Good quality service; nice customer service; they are happy to help with a smile.
Scrambled eggs with casserole and toast waited 30 minutes. At 12:30pm the main menu was denied and showed only breakfast available. Prices are much higher than other places.
"Nice view, good staff, clean place and nice atmosphere."
Nice food and good service; located just near the beach as well.
It was very nice to be greeted with a smile when we first entered; we went with my wife; the services are very fast; the empty services are removed immediately; the washbasins were hygienic and clean; and I would recommend a very reasonable place.
Kebabs are good; trotters are good; desserts are good. Actually; the decor part of the atmosphere is good. Only a lot of noise comes from the kitchen part. Employees are smiling.
If you come to Antep; sit down and taste the Beyran soup; served plain and with garlic.
I asked for garlic; but I had a hard time getting the taste of the meat from the garlic flavor. I'll try again with little or no garlic. Quite satisfying. I like the taste too; you should definitely try it.
Taste was amazing! Price was not high.
